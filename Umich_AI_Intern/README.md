**Additional Cases that do not include in the question examples:**
1. Case `3-3` is considered as (3, -3), with sum of 0
2. Case `--3` is considered as (-3), with sum of -3

**Note:**
Moreover, the example asks to return an empty string if there is no number in the input string parameter. However, it is generally an anti-pattern for function design (to return an empty string for certain cases while others return int). Although it is feasible in dynamic languages such as python, it causes confusion for callers.
